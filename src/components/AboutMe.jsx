            Iâ€™ve spent the past few years studying the latest and greatest technologies to pursue my passion in the field of Computer Science. Currently, 
            I am a <span className='about-bolded'>student at the University of Michigan Ann Arbor</span>, but my interest in what I learn expands far beyond campus. 
          </p>
          <p className="about-text">
            Driven by an <span className='about-bolded'>insatiable curiosity</span> and a <span className='about-bolded'>constant thirst for learning</span>, 
            I continually seek to explore new areas and deepen my understanding of the tech world. This curiosity has led me to embrace a variety of 
            professional experiences, working across different areas of software engineering, machine learning, data science engineering, front-end 
            and back-end systems development. <span className='about-bolded'>My primary goal</span> is to create impactful, applicable user 
            oriented solutions to problems that <span className='about-bolded'>make a difference</span>.
          </p>
          <p className="about-text">
            Outside of my IDE, you will find me pursuing my hobbies. I enjoy playing the electric guitar, viewing the world 
            behind the lens of my camera, as well as following and playing sports such as basketball, tennis, and football.
