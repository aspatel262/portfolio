            Iâ€™ve spent the past few years studying the latest and greatest technologies to pursue my passion in the field of Computer Science. Currently, 
            I am a student at the University of Michigan Ann Arbor, but my interest in what I do expands far beyond campus. 
          </p>
          <p className='text-lg lg:text-xl text-gray-700 mb-4'>
            I come fully prepared with professional experiences, working across different areas of software engineering, machine learning, data science engineering,
            front end and back end systems development, with the primarily goal focusing on creating impactful, applicable user experiences.

            Outside of my IDE, you will find me pursuing my hobbies. I enjoy playing the electric guitar, viewing the world 
            behind the lens of my camera, as well as following and playing sports such as basketball, tennis, and football.
